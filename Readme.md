# Turbin3 Advanced Rust

Welcome to Turbin3's Advanced Rust program. This program aims to facilite your growth and learning as a Solana developer branching out from non-native Rust developer background. By the end of the program, each participant should feel confident in their ability to:

1. Write, test and deploy native Rust programs
2. Optimize programs for CU and space savings
3. Create their own libraries and abstractions to achieve both of these outcomes

### Course Structure

The course will run **3 days a week** for a duration of **5 weeks** in total. This is split into two main parts: **Writing smart contracts**, and **optimizing contracts and libraries**.

Course structure and key competencies are as follows:

1. Introduction and Vault
   1. Account checks, serialization, discriminators and security
   2. Native Rust Vault program
   3. Testing Native Rust programs in Rust and Typescript
2. Escrow
   1. Native Rust Vault Program (1/2)
   2. Native Rust Escrow Program (2/2)
   3. Testing and Benchmarking an Escrow
3. AMM
   1. Native Rust AMM Programs (1/2)
   2. Native Rust AMM Program (2/2)
   3. Optimizing and benchmaking an AMM
4. Unsafe Rust and Non-standard libraries
   1. Introduction to unsafe Rust
   2. Replacing Solana-Program
   3. NoStd entrypoint and CPI
5. Extreme optimization
   1. Writing a custom entrypoint
   2. Assembly optimization
   3. Present your own non-standard optimization

### Week 1 - Native Rust Vault

In this module, we will dive deep into:

- Mastering account checks
- Native Rust program security
- Serialization and discriminators
- Program structure 
- Testing a Native Rust program

The final outcome of this week is that all students will successfully build and test their own native Rust vault program. The vault program be be able to deposit and withdraw from a program-controlled vault account via PDA signing of an account derived from the depositor's signing address.

### Week 2 - Escrow

In this module, we will look at:

- Writing an Escrow in Native Rust program security
- Serialization and discriminators
- Program structure  

The final outcome of this week is that all students will successfully build and test their own native Rust vault program, enabling them to safely deposit and withdraw lamports from a program-controlled vault account via PDA signing of an account derived from the depositor's signing address.
