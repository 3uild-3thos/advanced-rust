# Turbin3 Advanced Rust

Welcome to Turbin3's Advanced Rust program. This program aims to facilite your growth and learning as a Solana developer branching out from non-native Rust developer background. By the end of the program, each participant should feel confident in their ability to:

1. Write, test and deploy 3 native Rust programs
2. Optimize programs for space and CU savings
3. Create their own libraries and abstractions to achieve both of these points

### Course Structure

The course will run **3 days a week** for a duration of **5 weeks** in total. This is split into two main parts: **Writing smart contracts**, and **optimizing contracts and libraries**. 

Course structure and key competencies are as follows:

1. Introduction and Vault
   1. Account checks, serialization, discriminators and security
   2. Native Rust Vault program
   3. Testing Native Rust programs in Rust and Typescript
2. Escrow
   1. Native Rust Vault Program (2/2)
   2. Native Rust Escrow Program (2/2)
   3. Optimizing an Escrow
3. AMM
   1. Native Rust AMM Programs (1/2)
   2. Native Rust AMM Program (2/2)
   3. Optimizing an AMM
4. Non-standard libraries
   1. Introduction to unsafe Rust
   2. Solana Program is TOO slow
   3. Nostd-entrypoint and CLIs
   4. 
   5. Inline assembly
5. Extreme optimization
   1. Writing a custom entrypoint
   2. Writing a vault in assembly

#### Week 1 - Native Rust Vault

In this module, students will be required to make their own native Rust vault program capable of depositing and withdrawing lamports from a program-controlled vault account via PDA signing of an account derived from the depositor's signing address.

##### Key competencies:

1.1 - Account checks, serialization and security
1.2 - Native Rust vault program
1.3 - Program testing in Native Rust

3. We will be delving into

### Smart contracts

In the Smart Contracts portion of the course, we will be aiming to achieve the following competencies:

1.1 - Create a secure Native Rust vault program.

1.2 -
