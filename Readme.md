# Turbin3 Advanced Rust

Welcome to Turbin3's Advanced Rust program. The outcomes of this program are that each participant will feel confident in their ability to:

1. Create Native Rust programs, and
2. Optimize programs for space and CU savings
3. Create their own libraries and abstractions to achieve both of these points

### Course Structure

The course will be structured as follows:

1. Native Rust Vault

   1. Native Rust smart contract structure
   2. How to choose a 

2. We will be delving into

### Smart contracts

In the Smart Contracts portion of the course, we will be aiming to achieve the following competencies:

1.1 - Create a secure Native Rust vault program.

1.2 -
