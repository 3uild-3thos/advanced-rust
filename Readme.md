# Turbin3 Advanced Rust

Welcome to Turbin3's Advanced Rust program. This program aims to facilite your growth and learning as a Solana developer branching out from non-native Rust developer background. By the end of the program, each participant should feel confident in their ability to:

1. Write, test and deploy 3 native Rust programs
2. Optimize programs for space and CU savings
3. Create their own libraries and abstractions to achieve both of these points

### Course Structure

The course will run **3 days a week** for a duration of **5 weeks** in total. The course is split into two parts: **Writing contracts**, and **optimizing contracts**. The course structure and key competencies required are as follows:

1. Native Rust Vault
   1. Account checks, serialization, discriminators and security
   2. Native Rust escrow program
   3. Testing Native Rust p
2. Native Rust Escrow
3. Native Rust AMM
4. Writing our own frameworks and libraries
5. Extreme optimization

#### Week 1 - Native Rust Vault

In this module, students will be required to make their own native Rust vault program capable of depositing and withdrawing lamports from a program-controlled vault account via PDA signing of an account derived from the depositor's signing address.

##### Key competencies:

1.1 - Account checks, serialization and security
1.2 - Native Rust vault program
1.3 - Program testing in Native Rust

3. We will be delving into

### Smart contracts

In the Smart Contracts portion of the course, we will be aiming to achieve the following competencies:

1.1 - Create a secure Native Rust vault program.

1.2 -
